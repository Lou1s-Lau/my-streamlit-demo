    st.markdown("""
    Medical imaging techniques like **Computed Tomography (CT)** and **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** are cornerstones of modern medicine, providing invaluable visual information for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring disease progression. A critical step in analyzing these images is **segmentation**—precisely outlining anatomical structures or pathological findings (e.g., tumors or lesions). Accurate segmentation allows doctors to measure volumes, assess morphology, and track changes over time, directly impacting clinical decisions.  

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, particularly deep learning, has driven significant progress in **fully automated segmentation**. These tools can analyze large volumes of scan data rapidly and consistently. However, purely automated approaches often encounter difficulties in real-world clinical scenarios:

* **Fuzzy boundaries.** When tumor margins are obscured—e.g., a glioma blurred by peri-tumoral edema on brain MRI, or a small pulmonary nodule hugging a blood vessel on CT—local contrast is low and automated models struggle to decide where tissue A ends and tissue B begins.  
* **Rare pathologies.** Uncommon entities such as solitary vascular malformations of bone or cartilage–bone tuberculosis appear only a handful of times in public datasets; models rarely “see” them during training and therefore mis-segment or completely miss them (Zhang et al., 2021).

**Interactive segmentation** creates a synergy between **human expertise** and **AI efficiency**. Instead of trusting a one-shot automated mask or resorting to labor-intensive manual outlining, the clinician provides minimal, targeted feedback:

> **Interactive workflow**  
> 1. *Click:* The physician adds one or two **positive clicks** inside the lesion, and, if needed, **negative clicks** just outside it.  
> 2. *Encoding:* Each click is encoded as an extra channel (foreground = 1, background = –1, elsewhere = 0) and concatenated to the image.  
> 3. *Inference:* The model performs a short forward pass (< 5 ms on a single GPU; Liu et al., 2023) to generate an updated mask.  
> 4. *Visual feedback:* The refined contour is super-imposed on the image; the doctor either accepts it or adds more clicks until satisfied.

This human-in-the-loop process leverages the clinician’s anatomical knowledge—especially useful for ambiguous or unusual findings—while the AI handles the pixel-level heavy lifting. Studies show the collaboration cuts segmentation time from minutes to seconds and improves Dice similarity in challenging cases (Liu et al., 2022).  

Below, **Figure 1** illustrates a tri-planar knee MRI whose cartilage–bone interfaces often have low contrast; interactive tools can delineate these structures more accurately than fully automated ones.

**Figure 1: Tri‑planar MRI of the Knee**

This composite image shows three standard MRI views of the knee:

1. **Axial Plane (left):** A horizontal slice through the femoral condyles and tibial plateau, highlighting cartilage surfaces, menisci, and potential meniscal tears.  
2. **Coronal Plane (center):** A vertical, front‑to‑back view of the knee joint, ideal for assessing cartilage thickness, joint space narrowing, and medial/lateral compartment integrity.  
3. **Sagittal Plane (right):** A side‑view slice that visualizes the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL/PCL), femoral trochlea, and patellofemoral joint, critical for diagnosing ligament injuries and patellar tracking issues.

These multi‑planar MRI images serve as the input for interactive segmentation models like iSegFormer and SimpleClick, enabling precise delineation of cartilage, menisci, and ligaments to support faster and more accurate clinical diagnosis.

# 2. Background
elif page == "Background":
    st.title("Background: Deep Learning & Medical Image Segmentation")
    st.markdown("""
    Deep learning has profoundly transformed medical image analysis. By employing multi-layer neural networks, these techniques automatically learn hierarchical features directly from image data—progressing from simple edges and textures in early layers to complex anatomical structures or pathological patterns in deeper layers. This capability is central to advancing image segmentation for clinical applications.

    Within this domain, two primary paradigms exist: fully automated segmentation and interactive segmentation, often leveraging distinct deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs).

    ### Fully Automated Segmentation: Efficiency and Challenges

    **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** have long been the workhorse for **fully automated** medical image segmentation. Architectures like the U-Net excel at capturing local spatial patterns using learnable convolutional kernels. A notable example is the work by **Zhang et al. (2021)**, who utilized a CNN-based U-Net enhanced with a **spatial attention mechanism** for automated knee cartilage segmentation. This attention mechanism mimics human visual focus, allowing the model to concentrate on critical image regions, thereby improving accuracy.

    The primary advantage of fully automated methods lies in their efficiency and consistency. They can process large batches of images without human intervention, streamlining workflows. However, their performance can degrade when faced with certain challenges:
    * **Ambiguous or Fuzzy Boundaries:** Low contrast between tissues, such as tumor margins obscured by edema, can confuse automated algorithms.
    * **Image Quality Issues:** Noise or motion artifacts can hinder accurate segmentation.
    * **Data Scarcity for Rare Conditions:** Uncommon pathologies or anatomical variations might not be well-represented in the training data, leading to suboptimal performance (Marinov et al., 2024).
    * **Limited Global Context:** Traditional CNNs primarily focus on local features and may struggle with lesions spanning large areas or requiring understanding of long-range spatial relationships within the image volume.

    ### The Rise of Transformers and Interactive Segmentation

    To address the limitations related to long-range dependencies and global context, **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** have emerged as a powerful alternative. ViTs operate by dividing an image into patches and utilizing a **self-attention mechanism**. This allows the model to weigh the importance of different image regions relative to each other, effectively capturing global context. This capability is particularly beneficial in volumetric medical images like 3D MRI scans, where anatomical structures span multiple slices (Liu et al., 2023).

    While ViTs can be used for fully automated segmentation, they have also become foundational for advanced **interactive segmentation** methods. Image segmentation itself involves assigning a class label (e.g., "bone," "cartilage," "tumor," "background") to every pixel or voxel, generating precise outlines crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, or monitoring disease progression.

    **Interactive segmentation** bridges the gap between automated efficiency and clinical nuance by incorporating expert knowledge directly into the segmentation loop. It allows clinicians to guide the algorithm, particularly for challenging cases. This "human-in-the-loop" approach typically involves simple user interactions:
    * Providing **positive clicks** inside the target region of interest.
    * Providing **negative clicks** in the background area just outside the target.

    These interactions provide real-time feedback to the model, which then updates its predictions to refine the segmentation mask. This process allows for correction of errors in edge cases—like distinguishing a tiny metastatic nodule adjacent to bone—often requiring only a few clicks and minimal time per image (Huang et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2021).

    ### Interactive Models in Practice: Balancing Accuracy, Speed, and Resources

    Several studies highlight the potential and nuances of interactive methods:

    * The **iSegFormer** model (**Liu et al., 2022**) exemplifies an interactive approach for 3D knee MRI segmentation. Built upon the **Swin Transformer**, it uses interaction to achieve high accuracy even with limited annotated data, requiring only fine-tuning. This demonstrates how interaction can compensate for smaller datasets. However, the authors note that such sophisticated models might demand significant computational resources (e.g., large memory), potentially posing implementation barriers in resource-constrained clinical settings.
    * In contrast, the **SimpleClick** method (**Liu et al., 2023**) focuses on efficiency and usability. Using a standard Vision Transformer, it enables clinicians to achieve high-quality segmentation with just a few intuitive clicks. The study highlights its state-of-the-art performance and strong generalizability to medical images, crucially noting its efficiency in terms of computation speed and resource consumption. This makes it particularly promising for busy hospital environments where diagnostic speed is critical for timely treatment decisions.

    ### The Spectrum of Segmentation Approaches

    In summary, fully automated and interactive segmentation methods represent a spectrum of tools. Fully automated systems, exemplified by the CNN-based approach of Zhang et al. (2021), offer high throughput and consistency for standardized tasks. Interactive systems, such as iSegFormer and SimpleClick leveraging Transformer architectures, provide clinician-driven precision, adaptability to ambiguous cases, and the ability to leverage expert knowledge dynamically. They excel where automated methods might falter but require user input. The choice between them—or a combination thereof—depends on the specific clinical application, the complexity of the images, and the available resources. Ultimately, both approaches aim to enhance the speed and accuracy of medical diagnoses derived from imaging data.

# 3. iSegFormer
elif page == "iSegFormer":
    st.title("iSegFormer: Interactive 3D Segmentation (Liu et al., MICCAI 2022)")
    st.markdown("""
    The **iSegFormer** framework, introduced by Liu et al. at **MICCAI 2022**, is an interactive-segmentation model tailored for **3-D knee MRI**. Cartilage in 3-D scans is thin, highly curved, and often merges visually with bone or meniscus, producing *fuzzy boundaries* that frustrate purely automatic methods. Slice-by-slice 2-D tools miss cross-slice context, while heavy 3-D networks demand large GPUs yet still falter on small datasets.

---

### Architectural highlights  

* **Hierarchical Swin-Transformer encoder** — Swin splits a 3-D volume into small *windows* and runs self-attention inside each window; the windows then shift slightly (*shifted-window attention*) so neighboring windows also exchange information. This design captures **local detail and global context at once**.  
* **Lightweight MLP decoder** — A tiny fully connected network (multi-layer perceptron) converts the encoder’s features back into a segmentation mask, keeping latency low during interactive updates.

---

### How the interaction works  

> **Four-step loop**  
> 1. The physician adds several **positive clicks** (🟢 inside cartilage) and **negative clicks** (🔴 outside cartilage).  
> 2. Each click is encoded in an extra channel (foreground = 1, background = –1, elsewhere = 0) and concatenated to the MRI.  
> 3. iSegFormer re-runs a forward pass in **< 5 ms on a single A40 GPU**, producing an updated 3-D mask.  
> 4. The refined mask overlays the image in real time; the doctor repeats step 1 if further refinement is needed.

With this **sparse guidance**—often < 5 clicks in only a few key slices—the model quickly converges on a clinically usable contour.

---

### Performance  

* Public knee-cartilage datasets report **Dice similarity > 0.90** (Dice = 1 is perfect overlap).  
* Minimal click effort yet near-expert accuracy.  
* Fine-tuning with only a handful of annotated volumes outperforms many fully automatic baselines that use larger training sets.

---

### Practical requirements  

A window-based Transformer over 3-D data is memory-hungry; the reference code uses an RTX A5000 (24 GB VRAM). Practical deployments may downsample, batch in patches, or offload inference to the cloud. Startup (loading weights, window mapping) takes ≈ 20–30 s, but **each subsequent interaction refreshes in milliseconds**, giving an almost live editing experience.

---

In short, iSegFormer shows that a **windowed Transformer + tiny decoder** can deliver **high-precision, low-latency** interactive 3-D segmentation—so long as sufficiently large GPUs are available—making it a viable tool for challenging musculoskeletal MRI cases.
